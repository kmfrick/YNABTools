# YNABTools

This repository contains some useful scripts to work with the [YNAB](www.ynab.com) budgeting app.

`n26ynab.py`: Python script to convert an N26 transaction .csv to the YNAB format.
This Python script is a conversion of the original C# project found [here](https://github.com/Tyr3al/N26ToYNAB). The original code is under the MIT License.
The conversion from C# to Python was partly done using OpenAI's ChatGPT. For more information about ChatGPT, visit https://openai.com/research/chatgpt.

`ynab2sankey.R`: R script to convert a YNAB expense report to the format used by [SankeyMatic](https://www.sankeymatic.com).
